            <p>tamanduá-cavalo,[9] papa-formigas-gigante[10] e urso-formigueiro-gigante,[10][11] é uma espécie de mamífero xenartro da família dos mirmecofagídeos,encontrado na América Central e na América do Sul. É a maior das quatro espécies de tamanduás e, junto com as preguiças, está incluído na ordem PilosaTem hábito predominantemente terrestre, diferente de seus parentes próximos, o tamanduá-mirim e o tamanduaí, que são arborícolas.</p>
            <p>É encontrado em diversos tipos de ambientes, desde savanas a florestas. Prefere forragear em ambientes abertos, mas utiliza florestas e áreas mais úmidas para descansar e regular a temperatura corporal.</p>

                    1790 - Celerifere - Invented by Comte Mede de Sivrac, it has two equal-sized wheels and a seat, but no steering, brakes, or pedals. The rider powers forward using their feet for a walking or running start then glides on the celerifere. A rider powers forward using their feet for a walking/running push-off and then glides on the celerifere.

                    1817 - Steerable Laufmaschine - This machine goes by many names, including the running machine, velocipede, Draisine, and the swift-walker. The wooden steerable laufmaschine has a steerable front wheel and is the first appearance of the two-wheeler principle.

                    1858 - Pedals - The steerable laufmaschine has pedals added to it. It’s unclear who was the first to add these. The credit either goes to Frenchman Pierre Michaux, his son Ernest Michaux, or Pierre Llament.

                    1863 - Boneshaker - Blacksmith Ernest Michaux invents the first commercially successful velocipede in 1863, which is now called the boneshaker. The boneshaker was made of stiff materials and straight angles which literally made it a “boneshaker” to ride on over common cobblestone roads.

                    1866 - Penny Farthing - British engineer, James Starley invents the penny farthing which is commonly known as the high wheeler. The penny farthing looks pretty silly compared to modern bicycles, and it was actually pretty difficult to ride. This difficulty limited the popularity of the high wheeler. Makers realized the bigger you make the front wheel, the farther you could travel with one pedal rotation, so wheels continued to become larger. These bikes cost an average worker six months worth of pay.

                    1868 - Rubberized Wheels - Clément Ader is granted the first patent for rubberized wheels. There was still room to improve on ride softness, so rubber tires with an empty core were also tried.

                    1876 - Caliper Brakes - English inventors Browett and Harrison patent an early version of the caliper brake.

                    1879 - Bicyclette - Henry J. Lawson patents the first rear wheel, chain-driven safety bicycle. Lawson’s earlier models were all lever-driven.

                    1885 - Rover Safety Bicycle - John Kemp Starley invents the rover safety bicycle in England. This is the first model to look like what we now think of as a standard bicycle. This model combines a low seat, strong metal for a chain, and two wheels that are similar in size.
